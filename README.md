# lavish discord automod badge

+ it's pretty simple , please make sure your bot is in atleast 15 servers to work , bot will create 9 rules throughout all guilds, once 100 rules are created overall , please wait atleast 24 hours for the badge to appear
+ run `node badge.js`
+ if it prints `0 rules have been created` , it is due to that server having max rules , create a server & invite your bot or delete some rules not made by your bot
